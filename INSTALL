- The short way

$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

- The explained way

Tagsistant uses autotools from GNU project to be portable across Unices.
To build Tagsistant you just need to run the ./configure script provided
inside this repository or archive.

Tagsistant provides some options to customize configure script behaviour.
Tagsistant specific options are:

  --enable-debug-stderr   print debugging statements on stderr instead of
                          using syslog [default=syslog]

  --enable-debug-free     double check before free()ing a symbol [default=no]

For a complete list, use ./configure --help. For an explanation of the
whole process please refer to INSTALL.GNU file.

- Dependencies

Tagsistant uses some external libraries you need to install before compiling.
The most important one is libfuse, a library which enables user space
applications to talk with kernel to provide a filesystem-like interface.

Each autotagging plugin will require specific libraries. Read carefully
the output of ./configure.
