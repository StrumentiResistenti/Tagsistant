0.8.1:
  - Implemented the 'required' relation. If a tag M is required by S
    then the S tag is shown only if the M tag has been already included
    by the last OR branch of the query, like in:

      store/M/
      store/P/Q/+/M/

    but will not be shown in:

      store/P/
      store/P/+/Q/

    The goal of this relation is to organize the tags in a hierarchical
    structure to keep the root directory clean. It somehow complement the
    function of namespaces.

  - Support for POSIX ACL on objects stored inside the store/ dir

  - Goes in the background before calling fuse_main(), which prevents
    the autotagging thread from being properly scheduled

0.8:
  - Triple tags (a.k.a. machine tags) first implementation!

  - renamed the tags/ directory as store/ and created a new tags/
    directory to allow a cleaner tag management from file managers

  - Alias first implementation. The user can create files in the
    alias/ directory. Each file contains a portion of a query.
    Aliases are listed inside the store/ directory like ordinary
    tags, but prefixed with an "=" sign. When the user includes
    the alias in a query it gets expanded.

  - fixed a bug in src/fuse_operations/flush.c which prevented
    proper file deduplication

  - the same bug caused a "too many open file" error; now fixed

  - first implementation of the negation operator -/ which subtracts
    from the result sets all the files that are tagged with the
    tag following the operator. For example:

      ~/myfiles/store/t1/t2/-/t3/@@
    
    returns the files tagged as t1 and t2 but not tagged as t3.

  - Added an SQL index on objects(checksum, inode) to speed up
    deduplication on large file sets

  - Implemented a hierarchical structure under archive/ to avoid
    to overcrowd it. The last TAGSISTANT_ARCHIVE_DEPTH digits of
    the object inode are reversed to form the hierarchy. If the
    depth is set to 1000 (three levels, a level per each zero),
    the object 87312___file.txt will be saved as:
    
      archive/2/1/3/87312___file.txt

  - removed call to dbi_conn_ping() if SQLite is used as backend.
    This should avoid a "no table in statement" warning returned
    by libDBI version provided on some distros (ArchLinux).
    Thanks to Jeremy Self for reporting.

  - fixed src/plugin.c for compiling against libextractor 0.6/1.x
    Thanks to Jeremy Self for providing the patch.

  - fixed relations/ paths parsing.
    Thanks to Jeremy Self for reporting.

  - implemented relations between flat and triple tags. Adapted the
    reasoner too.

  - parameter escaping in tagsistant_real_query() to prevent SQL
    injection and problems with filenames with single quotes inside

  - fixed tag_id caching

  - simplified the SQL query to check tagging of a file

  - implemented the ALL/ metatag which lists all the files in the
    repository. Files can be deleted from the ALL/ tag, but can't be
    created. This tag is also useful to re-scan the whole repository
    when a new autotagging plugin is added, by just doing a:

      $ touch ~/myfiles/store/ALL/@@/*
    
    Each file will be rescanned for tags and deduplicated too.

  - Added GLib based option parsing to allow mounting tagsistant from
    /etc/fstab

  - Added SVN revision number to build number. The new schema is:

      SVN.date.progressive

    where SVN is the svn revision number and date has the format YYYYMMDD.

  - Implemented tag groups using curly braces. A group of tags form a
    set of alternative tags that are equivalent for file matching. For
    example if the user wants all the files matching t1 and one of t2 or
    t3, she can express the query as:

      store/t1/{/t2/t3/}/@@
    
    This query is equivalent to:

      store/t1/t2/+/t1/t3/@@
    
    The benefit of this feature is evident when possible permutations
    increase, like in:

      store/t1/{/t2/t3/}/{/t4/t5/}@@
    
    where the query without tag groups would require four separate sets:

      store/t1/t2/t4/+/t1/t2/t5/+/t1/t3/t4/+/t1/t3/t5/@@
    
    Tag groups allow the use of both simple and triple tags. Tag groups
    can _not_ be nested.

  - Changed quote char in SQL queries with single quotes in place of double
    quotes. This fixed a bug which prevented the use of 'key' as a tag.

  - Implemented a startup procedure that checks for missing checksums in
    the objects table.

  - Implemented the "excludes" relation between tags

  - Implemented the tags suffix. When appended to an object path it
    automagically generates a file listing all the tags applied to the
    object. For example, if the user creates the file:

      touch ~/myfiles/store/t1/t2/@@/file.txt
    
    he can list the file tags by:

      cat ~/myfiles/store/t1/@@/file.txt.tags
      t1
      t2
      document
      [...]

    This applies to any object, including directories:

	  mkdir ~/myfiles/store/t1/t2/@@/mydir
	  cat ~/myfiles/store/t1/t2/@@/mydir.tags
	  t1
	  t2

    The suffix can be configured with the command line argument
	--tags-suffix=<.tags>

  - Error reporting system: when a query is syntactically wrong,
    Tagsistant list only one file called "error" which contains a
    useful error message
  
  - Davide Eynard spotted an error on reading established relations.
    Fixed by replacing double quotes with single quotes on a SQL query
    inside readdir()

  - Implemented a read check on /etc/fuse.conf to grant the used is
    member of the fuse group. Thanks again to Davide Eynard for pointing
    me on this.

  - Autofix the archive/ structure from the old flat structure to the new
    hierarchical structure based on reversed inodes.

0.7:
  - libextractor integration. Tagging plugins have been converted to
    the new API.

  - multiple version of libextractor (0.5.x and >= 0.6.x) are supported.
    The code for 0.6.x still need some testing. The plugins should check
    the values returned by libextractor to avoid meaningless tagging

  - getattr() on relations/tag/... returned succesfully even if tag/
    didn't exist. Fixed.

  - tagsistant_open(), tagsistant_read() and tagsistant_write() now
    reuse the filehandle by saving it in fuse_file_info.fh field.

  - created tagsistant_invalidate_and_set_cache_entries() and used in
    tagsistant_querytree_find_duplicates(), tagsistant_unlink(),
    tagsistant_rmdir() and tagsistant_rename() to properly delete
    cache entries.

  - the plugins save their filter regexp in the repository.ini file
    each in its own section named [mime:mime/type] where mime/type
    is the mime-type processed by the plugin.

  - added a Mutex for the SQLite backend to solve concurrency problems
    related to database locks

  - added deduplication for symlinks; if a link to /some/path exists
    in the repository and a new one is created, the tags of the
    new one are applied to the existing object

  - added a new boolean parameter to tagsistant_querytree_new() to
    explicitly ask for a database connection; where the function
    gets called twice in one operation (rename, symlink, link, ...)
    one call will avoid the database connection creation

  - fixed building with libextractor 1.x (thanks to rkfg for reporting
    and to Ivan Kolmycheck for suggesting the fix).

0.6.1:
  - tag_id cache wasn't invalidated when a tag was renamed. Fixed.
    Thanks to Chiffa for reporting the bug.

  - tagsistant_guess_inode_from_and_set() didn't check object existence
    using a proper SQL query. Fixed by adding multiple condition, one
    for each AND-set, and using group by on object.inode.

  - getattr() on relations/tag/... returned succesfully even if tag/
    didn't exist. Fixed.

  - nonexisting files in stats/ are no longer reported as existing by
    getattr()

0.6:
  - Removed do_reasoning argument from tagsistant_querytree_new(), being
    obsoleted by the '@@' operator.

  - Solved two bugs in deduplication which prevented real unlink() of the
    file from disk and leaved the old inode stored in AND_SET cache.

0.6 rc6:
  - Implemented no reasoning ending tag "@@" which prevents the reasoner
    from being called. Only objects with direct tagging will be returned
    as query results. Very useful while doing housekeeping of the archive,
    moving files in subtags. A new constant has been defined in tagsistant.h:

      #define TAGSISTANT_QUERY_DELIMITER_NO_REASONING "@@"

    and its value is reported by stats/configuration.
    
  - Added tagsistant_querytree_check_tagging_consistency() call to:
      src/fuse_operations/rmdir.c
      src/fuse_operations/release.c
      src/fuse_operations/flush.c
      src/fuse_operations/unlink.c

  - Changed tagsistant_rename() to return EXDEV if both from and to paths
    are not taggable. This will cause calling program to use
    open-read/write-close cycle to copy files. This is required if you
    are moving myfiles/tags/t1/@/directory/files* to myfiles/tags/t2/@/
    because source files* are not tagsistant managed objects (hence
    is_taggable is 0).

0.6 rc5:
  - Fixed a bug in src/fuse_operations/readdir.c which caused the inclusion
    of '@' and '+' even after a '+/' ending path.

  - fixed a bug in mkdir() which used tagsistant_create_and_tag_object() in
    place of tagsistant_force_create_and_tag_object()

  - reduced reasoner SQL queries

  - enabled some caches, properly working

  - tagsistant_querytree_check_tagging_consistency() moved from
    tagsistant_querytree_new() to fuse_operations, where appropriated:
      getattr.c
      link.c
      mkdir.c
      mknod.c
      open.c
      symlink.c

  - mknod() created new files using provided mode_t permissions. If user
    was not granted write permission, following open() and write() calls
    would fail. I've forced S_IWUSR in mknod() mode_t permissions to fix
    the situation.

  - If requested DBD driver is not available, a message is printed

  - Debugging output uses --debug=<profile> switch, where <profile> is a
    string containing any combination of the following flags:

      b: boot
      c: cache
      f: file tree (readdir)
      F: FUSE operations (open, read, write, symlink, ...)
      l: low level
      p: plugin
      q: query parsing
      r: reasoning
      s: SQL queries
      2: deduplication

  - Implemented tag_id cache.
  
  - Implemented inode resolution by objectname and and_set cache.
  
  - Moved resoning code to reasoner.c

  - Deleted some dead code.

  - Avoided some transactions where no SQL insert/update were involved.

0.6 rc4:
  - When a tagsistant_querytree object was fetch from the cache, the
    transaction_started field were not set accordingly to
    tagsistant_querytree_new() actual parameters, thus preventing proper
    SQL transaction commit. This bug was especially evident inside
    rename() calls.
    
  - stats/ now contains some meaningful files:
      cached_queries: how many queries got cached
      configuration: the whole configuration given at run time
      connections: how many connections to SQL are active
      objects: how many objects are tagged
      relations: how many relations are established
      tags: how many tags have been created

  - repository.ini file implementation

  - removed any warning at compile time

  - code cleanup
    
0.6 rc3:
  - Queries are cached. Since a lot of time is spent by
    tagsistant_querytree_new() in reasoning the tags of a query,
    once is done a copy of the data structure is saved in a hash
    table and later reloaded. Performance improved by a 5-10x.
    
  - Tag removal (rmdir ~/mifiles/tags/a_tag/) lead to an error. Bug
    reported by Lingnan.
    
  - Speeds up reasoning by cutting one SQL query every three.

0.6 rc2:
  - Bug reported by Matei David:
      $ mkdir myfiles/tags/tag-a
      $ mkdir myfiles/tags/tag-b
      $ touch some-file
      $ cp some-file myfiles/tags/tag-a/tag-b/@/
      $ rm myfiles/tags/tag-b/@/some-file
      $ ls myfiles/tags/tag-a/@/
        ls: cannot access myfiles/tags/tag-a/@/some-file: No such file or directory

0.6 rc1:
  - Introduces universal tagging: not just files can be tagged, but
    directories and devices and pipes too.
